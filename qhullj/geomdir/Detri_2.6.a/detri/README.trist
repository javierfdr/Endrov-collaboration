README file: Trist module (3d TRIangle-edge data STructure).  Version 2.3

The triangle-edge data structure is a simplification of Dobkin and
Lazlo's edge-facet structure, which itself generalizes Guibas and
Stolfi's famous quad-edge data structure to 3D.  Trist allows you to
store 3D triangulations, or subcomplexes thereof, with 36 bytes per
triangle.  For a description of Trist and its triangle-edge functions
see Section 3.1 in [8].  Otherwise refer to the source code: trist.[ch].
