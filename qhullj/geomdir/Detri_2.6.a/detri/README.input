INPUT FORMAT

The raw data for the 3D alpha shape software are 3D points, each given
by its 3 coordinates.  Each point set is given in an ASCII data file
with the following simple format:

        #title: <TITLE>         title line (optional),
        #scale: <SCALE>         scale command (optional),
        #fix: <W>.<A>           fixed-point command (optional),
        # blah blah blah        comment line (ignored),
        <blank line>            blank line (also ignored),
        <X> <Y> <Z>             data line containing three coordinates.

The i-th data line of the input file holds the coordinates of point i.
It should be noted that the programs refers to a specific point by its
index.  Also note that the i-th data line is not necessarily the i-th
line of the input file.

By default, we require the coordinates to be integers; other types are to
be converted to integers with absolute values less than 2^31 = 2147483648.
It is, however, possible to specify coordinates in fixed-point format, using
the fixed-point command.  For example, the line

        #fix: 7.5

at the beginning of the data file, tells the program to expect coordinates
with up to 7 significant decimal digits, of which up to 5 are after the
decimal point.  So, coordinates like 55, -1234567, -5.5, 12.34567, or 0.00007 
are acceptable, but, for example, 7e-7 is not.

For additional convenience, the scale command multiplies all coordinates
uniformly.  For example,

        #scale: 1e-3

divides the given coordinates by 1000 each.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Internally, the code works with long-integer numbers.
The reason for this is the implicit use of a symbolic perturbation method
to resolve degenerate cases (see Edelsbrunner and Mucke [1]).  The scale
command is therefore relevant only to application programs with graphics
or output of metric information.  The fixed-point command also does internal
scaling.  Its main purpose is to enhance user-friendliness by allowing
fixed-point real input.

FORMAT CONVERSION UTILITIES

A utility function pdb2alpha is provided to convert standard protein
data bank (pdb) files to our input format.  Execute

        % pdb2alpha <INFILE> <OUTFILE>

where <INFILE> denotes the path of the file in pdb format and <OUTFILE>
is the path of the converted file in alpha shape input format.

AUTOMATIC DECOMPRESSION

If the code is compiled with the "automatic decompression" feature
turned on,  it will recognize compressed data files based on their
file extension -- *.Z for compress, *.z or *.gz for gzip -- and if
so, it will decompress the data on the fly.  This feature can be used
to save disk space.  For example, you can have a cronjob running a
script that routinely keeps your data files compressed; for example:

        % find $HOME -name \*.alf -exec compress '{}' ';'
        % find $HOME -name \*.dt  -exec compress '{}' ';'

would compress all the intermediate data files in your home directory
tree.  Keep in mind that ASCII files usually compress by more than
60%, whereas the binary *.dt and *.alf files compress only by 25-35%
and 35-50%, respectively.  Cf: man compress; man gzip; man crontab.
Also: GNU's gzip usually compresses far better than the standard
compress utility.

Note: If you wish, you can also keep the input files (the ones with
the point coordinates) compressed; but, eg, keeping the *.info files
compressed won't necessarily work.
