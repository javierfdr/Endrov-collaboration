This directory stores all the sources and makefiles of the Basic C Library.
To use any module of this library simply do a

        #include "basic.h"

in your source code, call or reference stuff from the desired module.
Compile the code with 

        -I<home_of_the_headerfile>

and link it with

        -L<home_of_the_library> -l_basic

The headerfile "basic.h" provides the function headings of ALL the
modules in the library as well as several (more or less :-) useful
macro extensions.

See README.make for installation, Makefile, and other remarks.

Enjoy,

        I think the best way I've heard this put is  "Pascal gives you a 
        water pistol filled with distilled water.   C not only gives you 
        a loaded .357, it points it at your head as a default.   Why  do 
        you think Pascal is taught in school? And which would you rather 
        have when there was a hungry bear in the area?"    --Jim Harkins
