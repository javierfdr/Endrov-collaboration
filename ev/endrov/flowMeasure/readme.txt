This plug-in counts the number of 3D objects in a stack and displays 
the volume, 
the surface, 
the centre of mass and 
the centre of intensity 


for each object. The threshold value can be adjusted using the first slider and user may navigate through the stack using a second slider. Results are presented both as a results table and as new stacks where either the full volume, the edges of each particle, the centre of mass or centre of intensity is represented. On this stack, each structure appears under a different colour. A tick box allows logging a summary of the overall measurement (useful to keep a track of successive counts).
