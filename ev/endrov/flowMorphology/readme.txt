non-flat gray morphology

ultimate point

(is there an evop to assign unique blob colors?)

double threshold

hitmiss, how to make it easier?

draw kernel

skeleton pruning
* prune N steps
* prune until convergence
* anchored skeleton

rank hit and miss



===============

method to restore spots? using distance?

texture restore predictor?

DIC: threshold -> distance -> watershed?
DIC: granu, several passes of DoC, find best match of sigma -> sigma map.
