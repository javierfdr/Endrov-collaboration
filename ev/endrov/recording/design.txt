how to design the manual GUI, with ROI handling etc?
scenarios

* stitching. select a ROI at 20x, then switch to 40x and get images all over
=> ROI system must be able to handle magnification

* mark multiple ROIs. move to ROIs with stage
=> alternative system: remember stage positions and recall. totally separate
=> otherwise: ROIs must refer to stage coordinates



Big Questions:
* separate ROI system for live camera and image window, or the same?
* live camera channel, should the channel translation change?
* when to update live camera window
* how to separate mouse-move-camera and mouse-move-imageview?

IF same ROI system, 



Mouse-move-systems:
* drag in live cam window (easy to compensate for magnification)
* drag on manual stage XY property (magnification?? only speed then)
* how the heck to do it in image window? new tool? not easy to use


possibility: can share image view code with live camera window
- messy to pull out code
+ support for other type of metadata
+ renderers already done
+ transforms will be consistent
+ maybe easier to use flows?
=> have to be able to override controls, totally
? selecting an object? or what? how to relate back to camera object?


possibility: recode renderer to work with ROI etc from image window
-- code duplication. transforms are a mess



=======================

* possibility of moving to lowest-res, tile-scan everything as an underlay for camwindow /ricardo
* virtual data object good /ricardo
* do not keep channel in ROIs
* ROIs for recording 2d + mid position (for stage)
