Zeiss cell observer
===============

* control of climate chamber during timelapse
* duration window, add experiments

* mark & find: multiwell. seems to be nothing but a system to calibrate positions of wells 
* 1D graph window - this will be required. online graphs?
* 3d deconv
* autofocus
* extended focus?
* mosaic
* HDR images
* channel unmixing
* tracking
* coloc
* Visual basic
* interactive measurement - user selects. geometric measures


Zeiss ZEN
===========
very vista lookalike
* autoexposure
* built-in list of fluorophores. offer linear unmixing from selection.
choosing wavelengths, strength? shows overlap, calculates crosstalk. allows optimization
of settings, automatic, with several recommended settings
* shows light path to some extent

for doing stacks, shows semi-3d view.
num slices, interval "set first/last"



Nicon elements
==========
realtime 2d deconv from autoquant
3d blind deconv
database! but screenshot tells it is thumbnails of recordings in a directory


koheras lasers control software
===========
laser has power & wavelength



oko vision
==========
avi maker: over time or z
joystick. can control even over the web
MW scan. seems one can turn wells on and off
incubator control. allows incubator to be turned off - avoids thermal shock due to PID control once opened and closed 


Siemens QVIA
=======
opencl renderer
volumes and geometry
shaded volume rendering (VRT)
unshaded VRT
render modes: MaxIP, MinIP, 2d MPR
multiplanar reformatting (MPR)
trilinear interpol
transfer functions
stereo rendering



imagej
==========
mosaicJ + turboreg to do stitching
trackEM2 for stitch etc?

micromanager
==========
user requested stitching with multiple cameras
