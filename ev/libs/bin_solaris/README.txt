Solaris comes in too many flavours and would bloat the distribution badly if we shipped the libraries.

The libraries might even be included in the OS. Please supply me information on Solaris if you run it.
Otherwise, download the libraries you need yourself and put them in here:

* JOGL https://jogl.dev.java.net/
* JAI
* JInput
