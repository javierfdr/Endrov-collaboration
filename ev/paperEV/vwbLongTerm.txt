EV/VWB Long-term plan
Database support
Both in-house databases for experiments and to connect outside databases. Replication for faster access.
SQL
Flat-file
AceDB
OO-mappers like hibernate
Intermediate storage – how are queries to be stored?
Algorithms
Sequence Alignment
Sequence searches like BLAST
Sequence conversion (between DNA, RNA etc)
Folding of RNA
Prediction of genes, structure
Prepare output for heavier computational software, like GROMACS (molecular dynamics simulation)
Data types
images + metadata (covered)
lineages (covered)
spatio-temporal expression (soon covered)
phylogenic trees
gene onthology
DNA, RNA, protein sequences (kiarash current)
alignments (kiarash current)
genome annotation: genes, transcription factors, exons (kiarash current)
protein structures, crystal, NMR, predicted. classification
RNA structures
Molecule data: structure, constants
cross-genome references: orthologs
experimental data like Affymetrix chip, rate constants, Y2H, PAGE
statistics like treatment, results etc
publications (ie pubmed)
lab reports, protocols
strain lists. plasmids etc
Other
viewers for all types of data and queries. *-* relationship between viewers and data. a sequence viewer might incorporate DNA, protein sequences and alignments at the same time etc.
pretty-printers: for output to publications
queries, extendable language
integration with other software like matlab, R
possibility to use the software as a library
grid computing?
No reason to limit the database to just medicine/bio/chemistry. With a plugin system, other areas can easily be incorporated.
