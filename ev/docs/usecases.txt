things that need further study

=====
want to calibrate resolution
=> integrate into line tool? point at line, as for distance
should a function be added to each metaobject to allow for change? or do like now, ignore?

===== stereology

===== want to find intensity along a line
===== show microscope scale on image
new annotation. drag a line (may want multiple). might want to just display totaly length; allow settings through right click?
===== save many image clips for publication
===== overlay grid for quick counting
need new image window tool to just show a grid.
* allow the setting of #w,h. 
* line, crosses, points possible
* color
* allow just horizontal and vertical lines - simple
* random offset

===== see colocalization
===== do ratio imaging
===== MRI t2 calculations
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/mri-t2.html
some image combinator
out = k/ln(s1/s2)   s are pixels
k is selected by user
===== kristian
use z projection always?
===== cell counter
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html
===== multi-circle overlay
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/concentric-circles.html
===== do FRET calculations
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fret/fret-calc.html
===== do FRAP
1. specify ROI
2. intensity over time -> outputs 1D graph
3. input graph into FRET calculator. it will detect the dip/starting point, the rest is simple
4. when doing multiple, take all values, put in a table (another flow)

when using endrov for acquisition, the flow can be autocreated

===== put various statistics in scatter diagramss

===== manually create classifiers from scatter diagrams
===== set up training set for automatic classification
