2.13
	new Image internals

	common "save as"

	Menu homogenisation
		Data into EV menu. Change EV into File
		"ImageWindow", better name for menu?
		"New XML" should just become "New"
		"Ev->info", create a Help menu
    
	JPEG2000 for OST. OME uses it! 
  
	simple recording  
    
    object hierarchy in menus etc
    
    
2.14
  Flows to create max channel
  Flows for calcium imaging
  
  Remove batch system, allow filters to be applied permanently
  	Can batch be removed? what about creating movies? change into Task?

  "Image" menu, and ROIs, how will this go with filters? I can imagine
     filters that take one image in and one out can be thrown into a menu. but should
     this way of working be promoted? 
  
     an image filter then has to be able to take an optional ROI. how does this work
     with live filters? should it be possible to attach a filter to a ROI?
     will it be possible to run a filter on a single frame? <why would you?>
  
     how is "analyze" done? graph output object? graph is not a very nice idea, but general
     rendering?
  
  
  
 2.15
	Store/load recording settings (exposure etc)
	stitching
	dynamic range 
    extended depth of focus
    surface from 2d-rendering
