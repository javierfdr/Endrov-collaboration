2.13
	DONE====
	
	common "save as"

	Menu homogenisation
		Data into EV menu. Change EV into File
		"ImageWindow", better name for menu?
		"New XML" should just become "New"
		"Ev->info", create a Help menu
	
    can any jars be deleted? EE?

	TODO====
	
	new Image internals
    
	JPEG2000 for OST. OME uses it! 
  
	simple recording  
    
    object hierarchy in menus etc
    
    make sure prop files can be converted
    
    possible to set compression level

    debian packages
    
    
    eliminate JAI, use Bioformats only
    
    separate movie encoder, put in macBinding
    
    micket==
    align items in rec
    arrows up/down ugly
    datum/tid i log console
    shutterikonen otydlig
    wants: limit on how far one can move outside, picture should never go completely outside
    flows: icons on items
    Ringa in lampan med slidern, gråskalorna med den andra slidern
    sätts en shortcut fås toFront-rekurzon
    
2.14
  Flows to create max channel
  Flows for calcium imaging
  
  Remove batch system, allow filters to be applied permanently
  	Can batch be removed? what about creating movies? change into Task?

  "Image" menu, and ROIs, how will this go with filters? I can imagine
     filters that take one image in and one out can be thrown into a menu. but should
     this way of working be promoted? 
  
     an image filter then has to be able to take an optional ROI. how does this work
     with live filters? should it be possible to attach a filter to a ROI?
     will it be possible to run a filter on a single frame? <why would you?>
  
     how is "analyze" done? graph output object? graph is not a very nice idea, but general
     rendering?
  
  
  
 2.15
	Store/load recording settings (exposure etc)
	stitching
	dynamic range 
    extended depth of focus
    surface from 2d-rendering
