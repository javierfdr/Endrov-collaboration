================================TODO===========================


2.13.TODAY
	image swap system & caching strategy
		::basics only. can use io. goes together with caching
		hm. register images in global list (constructor in evimage). on getimage methods, apply a priority queue.
		implement LRU. replace io. this will force all users to Set the image when they are done or theoretically
		they might be working on data no longer in memory!

2.13.1 -- file formats and schema
	working imserv (back to last standard, refactor later)
		::replicate data to imserv cache files. do NOT replicate OST format, use normal loader
		with lazy loading of blobs, it would be a lot less expensive to load imagesets
2.13.2 -- user interface

2.13.4 -- images, memory usage
	new Image internals

2.14.2 -- flows
	check code for UI
	real-time flows

	flag if a unit needs update
	
	FLOW MODES
		stand-alone on request
			continuous, open window?
			once on demand
		sub module in another flow
		
		
		math ops, on images vs in general. keep separate? seems hard.
		
		manual operation should maybe be separate from recording. hardware control window?
		
		
		
	
	Flows to create max channel
	Flows for calcium imaging
	  "Image" menu, and ROIs, how will this go with filters? I can imagine
	     filters that take one image in and one out can be thrown into a menu. but should
	     this way of working be promoted? 
	  
	     an image filter then has to be able to take an optional ROI. how does this work
	     with live filters? should it be possible to attach a filter to a ROI?
	     will it be possible to run a filter on a single frame? <why would you?>
	  
	     how is "analyze" done? graph output object? graph is not a very nice idea, but general
	     rendering?

ONTRAIN
2.13.x -- simple recording 
	how to do manual slices?
	how to do stacks? (manual??)
	how to do movies?
	FRAP? calcium?
	finalize hardware interface

	HOWTO
		recording templates. probably an OST with created channels and preset compression rates.
		and description. what about metadata that should go into imserv?

     
2.13.ATWORK     
	try to play with many objects on screen. update bug
		::::appears to be mac-only
	release jinput etc dependent libraries. on my own page if needed
    put OSX code in jar to simplify distribution? - no. compile once, disable code. send over .class
2.14.? -- platform integration
	X associate mime types
	mac quality: QT integration, in a jar?
	integration on windows?


=================== time for release here ==========================

	     
2.14.1 -- undo
	general framework
	encapsulate all operations

2.?.? -- ROIs
	ROI definition can be changed. makeinstance? or keep, change for object instance?
	implement arbitrary shape ROIs
	strategy for using ROIs
    ROIs are slow. probably too much redraw. see observers
    micket didn't find the ROI tool easily	

2.14.? -- GUI next round
    micket: limit on how far one can move outside, picture should never go completely outside
    micket: 2d zoom was slow    
    micket: 2d zoom at cursor
	imserv new +/- icon
    micket: arrows up/down ugly

2.14.? -- input
	full gamepad support
	rework keybindings

=================== time for release here ==========================


NOPRIORITY	  
2.13.3 -- release management
    separate micro-manager plugin
	can dh_ be used?
    dependencies can be put in a jar+manifest
    	but memory usage etc is harder to fix
    	OS dependent jars?
    	must be easy for end-user to add jars!
2.14.x
	jp2
	classloader to load jars instead of a starter? can JNI be dealt with?
		can the race condition be dealt with?
		one classloader for everything or singletons will be a problem.
	better use of observers. can they be made more fine-grained, like a tree of listeners?
		move up until finding one listener
	imserv better updating list. restrict length. new protocol
	log4j standard logging. suggest to micromanager too!!!!
  
  Remove batch system, allow filters to be applied permanently
  	Can batch be removed? what about creating movies? change into Task?
  
  
2.15 -- applications
	Store/load recording settings (exposure etc)
	stitching
	dynamic range 
    extended depth of focus
    surface from 2d-rendering
	the movie I got!!!
    
	movie encoding on linux

2.16 -- pre-3.0 QA
	deal with every TODO in the code
	all files should compile or disappear
	plugin for http://photosounder.com


6D := (X,Y,Z,Lambda(wavelength),T, multi stage points). 
  

flow ops =======================

matrix operations
least squares


  
  
debian problems ================
etchy base install
  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.lang.ProcessBuilder
  
install package classpath  
  
  
  
debian development ==========
gcj+classpath has problems. use openjdk
