================================TODO===========================

2.13.1 -- file formats and schema

	support hierarchy of objects properly
	    object hierarchy in menus etc
	    new widgets, new create function in widgets
	    which objects should be drawn in 2d? 3d?
	working imserv (back to last standard, refactor later)
	

2.13.2 -- user interface
	micket2: camera window does not play well with tiled wm since it rescales     
	play forward should always work
	image vox render should NOT attempt to show a progress bar if there is nothing to do

2.13.3 -- release management
	release jinput etc dependent libraries. on my own page if needed
	can dh_ be used?	
    separate micro-manager
    put OSX code in jar to simplify distribution?
    dependencies can be put in a jar+manifest

2.13.4 -- images, memory usage
	caching strategy
	image swap system
	new Image internals
     
2.13.x -- simple recording 
	how to do manual slices?
	how to do stacks? (manual??)
	how to do movies?
	FRAP? calcium?
	finalize hardware interface

	HOWTO
		recording templates. probably an OST with created channels and preset compression rates.
		and description. what about metadata that should go into imserv?
	     
2.14.1 -- undo
	general framework
	encapsulate all operations

2.?.? -- ROIs
	ROI definition can be changed. makeinstance? or keep, change for object instance?
	implement arbitrary shape ROIs
	strategy for using ROIs
    ROIs are slow. probably too much redraw. see observers
    micket didn't find the ROI tool easily	

2.14.2 -- flows
	check code for UI
	real-time flows
    flows: icons on items
	
	Flows to create max channel
	Flows for calcium imaging
	  "Image" menu, and ROIs, how will this go with filters? I can imagine
	     filters that take one image in and one out can be thrown into a menu. but should
	     this way of working be promoted? 
	  
	     an image filter then has to be able to take an optional ROI. how does this work
	     with live filters? should it be possible to attach a filter to a ROI?
	     will it be possible to run a filter on a single frame? <why would you?>
	  
	     how is "analyze" done? graph output object? graph is not a very nice idea, but general
	     rendering?

2.14.? -- platform integration
	X associate mime types
	mac quality: QT integration, in a jar?
	integration on windows?

2.14.? -- GUI next round
    micket: limit on how far one can move outside, picture should never go completely outside
    micket: 2d zoom was slow    
    2d zoom at cursor
	imserv new +/- icon
    micket: arrows up/down ugly

2.14.? -- input
	full gamepad support
	rework keybindings

2.14.x

	jp2

	classloader to load jars instead of a starter? can JNI be dealt with?
		can the race condition be dealt with?
		one classloader for everything or singletons will be a problem.
		
	better use of observers. can they be made more fine-grained, like a tree of listeners?
		move up until finding one listener
	imserv better updating list. restrict length. new protocol


	log4j standard logging. suggest to micromanager too!!!!


  
  Remove batch system, allow filters to be applied permanently
  	Can batch be removed? what about creating movies? change into Task?

	  
  
  
2.15 -- applications
	Store/load recording settings (exposure etc)
	stitching
	dynamic range 
    extended depth of focus
    surface from 2d-rendering
	the movie I got!!!
    
	movie encoding on linux

2.16 -- pre-3.0 QA
	deal with every TODO in the code
	all files should compile or disappear


6D := (X,Y,Z,Lambda(wavelength),T, multi stage points).
