New windows: 3d Surface plot
Other New tools:
	image angle
	image distance
	color picker

----------

LUT: this should be a filter
	
image
	print

	info?
	crop
	set color depth

	draw
		pencil
		brush
		spray
		flood fill
		eraser

	Derive (analyze?)
		Histogram
		eigenvalues??
		statistics??
		3d+t color distribution plot

other new features:
	load movies mpg etc?
features that can be skipped?
	selection.fit spline
	selection.fit elipse
	selection.make band

	Jython, Ruby integration
	shadows?

!!
* somehow get out profiles, spatial and in time
* somehow list threads, used memory etc
* FRET calculator
* FRAP calculator
* auto-check for updates
* open recent: XML and OST
