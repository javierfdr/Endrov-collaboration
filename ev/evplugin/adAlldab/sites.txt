GMOD is the Generic Model Organism Database Toolkit, a collection of software tools for creating and managing genome-scale biological databases. You can use it to create a small laboratory database of genome annotations, or a large web-accessible community database. GMOD tools are in use at FlyBase, WormBase, SGD, BeeBase and many other large and small community databases.
