Jubio
======================================================================

Jubio is a library for loading TIFF-stacks and PICT-stacks. It is written
in C++ by Johan Koch. The code has since been maintained by Johan Henriksson
who also wrote this Java binding.

Right now it is not a real plugin but some code depend on it.
