Lineage
======================================================================



tree assisted lineage
final cells & apoptotic cells
*find cells whic do not seem to follow lineage
*do it in order of number of divisions
*after flip, conflict below not acceptable
*when a cell divides, could try flips, try in order of distinct

window->correctLineage
*selected or all
*conflicts?
*once or continue
*type of correction



put together lineages/cell sets, how?
