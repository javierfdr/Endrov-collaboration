Image Window
======================================================================

The imageset viewing window. 

Idea for later; right now the filters are fixed (contr, br). Later there will
be more filters available for image processing, maybe allow user
to pick from all these and form a stack of filters to be applied before showing?
UI design is important here as it might become messy otherwise.

imsetkey :: String key -> (func) -> null



multiple imagesets, somehow
